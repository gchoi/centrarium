As I prepare for ViDi API examples for tomorrow's ViDi training session to our customer, I made ViDi API programming examples for each tool - Red Analyze, Green Classify, Blue Localize and Blue Read.

So I'd like to share them with you for your future ViDi API training session.

Each Visual Studio solutions contains its own ViDi runtime workspace and test images so that anyone can test them directly and seamlessly ðŸ˜Š

Just download and run it without navigating the paths!

Please refer to the following download link:

Feel free to use as it is or modify it for your own purposes.
